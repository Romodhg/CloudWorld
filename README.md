CloudWorld
==========

For my Digital Media Art class I am doing a social experiment to see what people do when Presented the opportunity to play Minecraft on a world that is played on then shared. This Virtual world is added to each builder adds to the precursors that came before. You as the builder can make anything, a narrative, art, parkour course, redstone contraption( not world breaking). Please feel free to adhere to those or to do your own thing. I want to see what people do with the chance to interact with others in the unique way.
